# Python Scripts

Python scripts that runs algorithms commonly asked in university exercises.

1. [Bresenham Line Generation](#bresenham-line-generation)
2. [Digital Differential Analyzer](#digital-differential-analyzer)

You need to have python 3.x.x installed in your machine to run the scripts from this repository. You can found how to install python [here](https://www.python.org).

To run a script `cd` into the folder and run the command:

`python SCRIPT_NAME.py`

### Bresenham Line Generation

Is an algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close
approximation to a straight line between two points.

### Digital Differential Analyzer

Is an algorithm used for interpolation of variables over an interval between start and end point. DDAs are used for
rasterization of lines, triangles and polygons. They can be extended to non linear functions, such as perspective
correct texture mapping, quadratic curves, and traversing voxels.

The support we give here is for raster:

 1. Lines
